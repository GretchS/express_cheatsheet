# Context
I don't often create express back-ends so I made this cheat sheet to refresh my memory of express and mongoDB syntax. This cheat sheet contains various modules that show how to perform various functions in Express (request handling, debugging, mongoDB, registration and authentication, etc), with lots of annotations.

Still in progress. More to come...
